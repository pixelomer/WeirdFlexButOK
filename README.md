# WeirdFlexButOK - WIP Flex Alternative

This is a Flex alternative that is still work-in-progress.

## TODO

- [x] Have a working version that can at least override selectors based on user input
- [x] Handle arguments in methods. This means overriding the values and then returning the value from the original implementation with modified values.
- [ ] C types such as int, char, char\* and bool (partially implemented with "Type" key for arguments when using "UnitType" 2)
- [ ] Ability to return the value from a different method with custom arguments.
